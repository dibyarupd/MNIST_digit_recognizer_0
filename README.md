# MNIST_digit_recognizer_0
Digit recognizer project using PyTorch and deep learning techniques.

This project is done by Dibyarup Deb. This project utilizes the power of PyTorch framework and also showcases my 'Neural Networks' skills. I will be updating this project from time to time since my learning is still ongoing in this field. 

The dataset which I have used in this project is the famous MNIST dataset. The latest test accuracy on the dataset which I achieved is 91% (using a baseline linear model).
